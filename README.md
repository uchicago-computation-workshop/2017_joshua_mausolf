**Joshua Mausolf** is a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago. He holds a BA, summa cum laude, from New York University, received his MA at the University of Chicago, and was a summer fellow at Data Science for Social Good. Joshuaâ€™s general interests intersect at the boundaries of sociology, political science, and economics, which he explores using computational and statistical methods. He is broadly interested in social stratification and inequality, labor markets, corporate boards and organizations, campaign finance, political ideology and polarization, political and media discourse, and social movements.
